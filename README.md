# 03-Password-Generator
Website for a random password generator

## Description

This website was created as a random password generator using HTML, CSS & mainly JavaScript. Completing this challenge helped reinforce JavaScript syntax, fundamentals & styling. I mainly learned how JavaScript is used to power HTML & CSS, how to use functions, arrays, loops and conditional statements to acheive my results.

### User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

### Acceptance Criteria
